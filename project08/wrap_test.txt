I failed t
he first q
uarter of 
a class in
 middle sc
hool, so I
 made a fa
ke report 
card. I di
d this eve
ry quarter
 that year
. I forgot
 that they
 mail home
 the end-o
f-year car
ds, and my
 mom got i
t before I
 could int
ercept wit
h my fake.
 She was P
ISSED—at t
he school 
for their 
error. The
 teacher a
lso retire
d that yea
r and had 
already th
rown out h
is records
, so they 
had to tak
e my mothe
r’s “proof
” (the fak
e ones I m
ade throug
hout the y
ear) and “
correct” t
he “mistak
e.” I’ve n
ever told 
her the tr
uth.
